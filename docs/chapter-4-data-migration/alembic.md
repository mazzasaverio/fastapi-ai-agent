### Enhanced Alembic Migrations Documentation

#### Migration Naming Convention

When creating migration scripts, adhere to a consistent naming scheme that reflects the nature of the changes. The recommended format is `date_slug.py`, where `date` represents the creation date and `slug` provides a brief description of the migration's purpose. For example, `2022-08-24_post_content_idx.py`.

#### Configuration File Template

In the `alembic.ini` file, define the file template to ensure that all migration scripts follow the established naming convention. The template should look like this:

```ini
file_template = %%(year)d-%%(month).2d-%%(day).2d_%%(slug)s
```

This ensures that every new migration script includes the date and a descriptive slug.

#### Automated Migration Script Generation

To streamline the process of creating migration scripts, use the `--autogenerate` option with the `alembic revision` command. This feature compares the current state of your database schema with your SQLAlchemy models and generates a migration script accordingly. Here's how you can use it:

```bash
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Create tables"
```

Replace `"Create tables"` with a message that accurately describes the changes being implemented.

#### Applying Migrations

After generating the migration scripts, apply them to your database with the `alembic upgrade` command followed by `head`. This command executes the migration scripts against your database, bringing it up to date with the latest schema changes.

```bash
alembic upgrade head
```

By following these practices, you maintain a clear and organized history of your database schema changes, making it easier to manage and understand the evolution of your data model over time.
